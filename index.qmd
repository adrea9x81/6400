## About Me

I hold a Master's degree in Digital Marketing from Cal Poly Pomona, where I developed expertise in marketing analytics, campaign strategy, and consumer behavior research. My work bridges creativity and analysis â€” from developing branding strategies to designing dashboards and conducting in-depth price sensitivity studies.

With a background in public relations, leadership, and community engagement, I bring a human-centered approach to everything I do. Whether leading workshops, crafting marketing plans, or analyzing user data, I focus on creating meaningful impact through thoughtful communication and smart strategy.
